# Combination Java Program

This Java program allows the user to enter an array of numbers and a target value. It then finds combinations of two numbers from the array whose sum is equal to the target value. The program also merges the array into a single array and sorts it before finding combinations for a doubled target value.

## Getting Started
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler. For example:

    ``javac Combination.java``

2. Run the compiled Java class file. For example:

    ``java Combination``

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter the numbers of the array separated by commas. For example:

    ``Enter the numbers of the array (using comma):  1,3,2,2,-4,-6,-2,8``

2. The user will then be asked to enter the target value. For example:

    ``Enter the target value: 4``

3. The program will display the first combination of two numbers from the array that sums up to the target value. For example:

    ``First Combination For 4:  [[1, 3], [2, 2], [-4, 8]]``

4. The program will merge the array into a single array and sort it. For example:

    ``Merged into a single Array: [-6, -4, -2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 8]``

5. The program will then find combinations for a doubled target value. For example, if the target value was 10, the doubled target value would be 20. The combinations will be displayed. For example:
    ``Second Combinations For 8: []

6. The program execution will end.
